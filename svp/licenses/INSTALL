********************


Recommended Linux version: Ubuntu >= 18.04 64-bit


Pre-requirements
====================
Despite of the Linux distro in use you'll need to pre-install:

1. Qt >= 5.9
2. Vapoursynth >= R31
3. MediaInfo
4. lsof command line tool (install it via your package manager)
5. Required for SVPtube: Python 3.8
6. (recommended) Proprietary video drivers including OpenCL ICD
7. (recommended) mpv >= 0.28 built with Vapoursynth support
8. (optional) Recommended UI for mpv: SMPLayer
9. (optional) VLC 3.0 or later (NOT a Snap version)


In case of Ubuntu
=====================

== Ubuntu 16.04+ specific ==

# Ubuntu 16.04 - Qt5Concurrent package is not installed by default!
sudo apt-get install libqt5concurrent5 libqt5svg5 libqt5qml5

# Python 3.8 - needed for SVPtube
# Ubuntu 18.04 have it in the "updates" repo
add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
apt-get update

apt-get install libpython3.8

== Common packages ==

# mediainfo
sudo apt-get install mediainfo

!!!!!
mpv and Vapoursynth: build them on your own!
djcj's PPA is missing since 18-Apr-2019, see mpv building instructions below!
!!!!!

# SMPlayer:

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:rvm/smplayer 
sudo apt-get update 
sudo apt-get install smplayer smplayer-themes smplayer-skins

# VLC

sudo apt-get install vlc


In case of Arch
=====================
# common packages
pacman -S qt5-base qt5-declarative qt5-svg libmediainfo lsof vapoursynth

# mpv with Vapoursynth support
# AUR packages to install: rsound spirv-cross mpv-full

# svpcode
pacman -S mkvtoolnix-cli

# if you want svpcast to be able to discover AppleTVs
pacman -S avahi
systemctl enable avahi-daemon.service


mpv configuration
=====================
Just add "--input-ipc-server=/tmp/mpvsocket" to mpv args (or config file) and SVP should find it.
Alternatively you can "open" video file via SVPManager - it'll execute mpv with the correct argument.

As Vapoursynth processing requires a "copy-back" video decoder, you have to also include
--hwdec=audo-copy

VLC configuration
=====================
As of now SVP assumes that VLC installed into /usr/bin, /usr/lib etc.

SVP's plugin for VLC replaces the "deinterlace" filter. To be able to quickly switch them from SVP's main menu 
you may need to change VLC's plugins folder access rights:

chmod -R a+W /usr/lib/vlc/plugins/video_filter

Then "install" or "uninstall" SVP's plugin via SVP main menu -> Utilities -> SVP in VLC.
If it doesn't work then manually put the plugins path (e.g. "/usr/lib/vlc/plugins") into main.setup.vlc.plugins property in SVP's All settings.

You must turn on deinterlace in VLC via Video -> Deinterlace -> On to start using SVP's plugin.
Alternatively you can turn it on permanently: Tools -> Preferences -> Video -> Deinterlacing = On

Note: Hardware decoding may not be compatible with the Vapoursynth filter!


Building 3rd-party apps from sources
====================================
The following tested on Ubuntu 19.04 right after the clean installation.

1. Vapoursynth

# common build tools
sudo apt-get install autoconf automake libtool pkg-config nasm git

# zimg library
git clone https://github.com/sekrit-twc/zimg.git
cd zimg   
./autogen.sh
./configure
make -j4
sudo make install

cd ..

# Cython for Python3
sudo apt-get install cython3

# build Vapoursynth!
git clone https://github.com/vapoursynth/vapoursynth.git
cd vapoursynth
./autogen.sh
./configure
make -j4
sudo make install
cd ..

sudo ldconfig

2. mpv with Vapoursynth support

# install dependencies: add more if you want additional ffmpeg/mpv codecs and features
sudo apt-get install python-minimal libssl-dev libfribidi-dev libluajit-5.1-dev libx264-dev xorg-dev libegl1-mesa-dev 
# you need at least one of these to enable audio output
sudo apt-get install libasound2-dev libpulse-dev

git clone https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv-build.git
cd mpv-build

# minimal install, feel free to add more options to ffmpeg_options and mpv_options
echo --enable-libx264 >> ffmpeg_options
echo --enable-vapoursynth >> mpv_options
echo --enable-libmpv-shared >> mpv_options
./rebuild -j4
sudo ./install
cd ..

Issues
=====================
One major issue is incompatibility between the way system tray icon/menu implemented in Qt now and some display managers.
For example in Xubuntu 15.10/Xfce tray icon is completely unusable. 
Because of this SVP runs w/o tray icon by default, BUT it's possible to switch Windows behaivor with "-tray" command line arg.

For GPU acceleration support use proprietary video drivers with (probably) some additional modules - search for "OpenCL ICD".
For example in case of NV cards "nvidia-modprobe" package is needed for OpenCL to work.
Check the installation with utils/clinfo.

"Auto" settings expect hardware video decoding which may be unavailable for mpv with Vapoursynth video filter enabled. 
So you may need to lower SVP settings manually.

Unlike the Windows version, SVP 4 Linux doesn't measure actual screen refresh rate, but uses OS provided value instead. 
For 59.xxx Hz screens this value is often rounded to "59.0", so you'll get sub-optimal FRC rate like 25/11 instead of 5/2. 
To avoid this use fixed "Movie x2.5" target rate.

Fix for the following error:
/usr/bin/mpv: symbol lookup error: /usr/bin/mpv: undefined symbol: ass_set_check_readorder
is
apt-get install libass5
